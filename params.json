The original website for Meld is here [https://meld.app](https://meld.app/). Minor work has been done to also integrate OSX menu and shortcuts, but the app is truly the original, excellent Meld.\r\n\r\n### :dvd: Download OSX dmg file\r\nYou may download any of the following versions. The 3.15.2 is the recommended version at this point.\r\n* [Version 3.15.2 (r2) - stable, recommended](https://github.com/yousseb/meld/releases/download/osx-6/meldmerge.dmg) :star:\r\n* [Version 3.13.4 - stable](https://github.com/yousseb/meld/releases/download/osx-4/meldmerge.dmg)\r\n* [Version 1.8 - stable](https://github.com/yousseb/meld/releases/download/osx-v1/meldmerge.dmg)\r\n\r\n> :bulb:**Tip:** A lot of people are asking how to use this package as a git difftool.\r\n> Once installed, edit your ```~/.gitconfig``` and add the following lines\r\n> ```\r\n\t[diff]\r\n\t\ttool = meld\r\n\t[difftool]\r\n\t\tprompt = false\r\n\t[difftool \"meld\"]\r\n\t\ttrustExitCode = true\r\n\t\tcmd = /Applications/Meld.app/Contents/MacOS/Meld \\\"$LOCAL\\\" \\\"$PWD/$REMOTE\\\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Why Meld for Mac/OSX and not Macports/Homebrew\r\nTop reasons behind using this fork over Macports or Homebrew builds:\r\n* Supports standard OSX shortcuts (cmd-c/cmd-v instead of ctrl)\r\n* Retina support (check the screenshot!)\r\n* Latest 3.x series\r\n* No hassle install (drag/drop like any other app)\r\n* Integrates with OSX menu\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n![screen shot 2014-12-30 at 11 59 11 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4719498/5577517/7b87d086-901b-11e4-8f73-08696600769d.png)\r\n\r\n### Special Thanks\r\n* To Kai Willadsen [https://meld.app/](https://meld.app/) for creating Meld.\r\n* To the Gnome project [https://www.gnome.org/](https://www.gnome.org/)\r\n* To  Alex Kras whose web page [How To Run Meld on Mac OS X Yosemite Without Homebrew, MacPorts, or Think](http://www.alexkras.com/how-to-run-meld-on-mac-os-x-yosemite-without-homebrew-macports-or-think/) served as my reference for tracking Meld of OSX usage and issues when I had absolutely no time to maintain this.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n* Get rid of the Meld wrapper shell script (this should get rid of all the wrappers needed to run Meld from the terminal)\r\n* Support Meld localizations (currently only English works)\r\n\r\n### Suggestions / Issues\r\nIf you have a suggestion or you are facing an issue running this fork of Meld, please open an issue here [https://github.com/yousseb/meld/issues](https://github.com/yousseb/meld/issues). Please note that your issue has to be specific to the OSX fork and not to Meld itself. I have no plans/time to work on Meld itself.\r\n\r\n### Contribute to Meld for OSX\r\n1.

Do your magic, commit and push to your fork.\r\n5. Create a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Not Accepting Donations\r\nI'm not currently accepting donations for the development of this fork.

Meld helps you compare files, directories, and version controlled projects. It provides two- and three-way comparison of both files and directories, and has support for many popular version control systems.\r\n\r\nMeld helps you review code changes and understand patches. It might even help you to figure out what is going on in that merge you keep avoiding.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Two- and three-way comparison of files and directories\r\n* File comparisons update as you type\r\n* Auto-merge mode and actions on change blocks help make merges easier\r\n* Visualisations make it easier to compare your files\r\n* Supports Git, Bazaar, Mercurial, Subversion, etc.\r\n* â€¦and [more](#in-depth-features)\r\n\r\nMeld is licensed under the [GPL v2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html), except as noted\r\n\r\n### In depth features\r\n#### File comparison\r\n * Edit files in-place, and your comparison updates on-the-fly\r\n * Perform two- and three-way diffs and merges\r\n * Easily navigate between differences and conflicts\r\n * Visualise global and local differences with insertions, changes and conflicts marked\r\n * Use the built-in regex text filtering to ignore uninteresting differences\r\n * Syntax highlighting\r\n\r\n#### Directory comparison\r\n * Compare two or three directories file-by-file, showing new, missing, and altered files\r\n * Directly open file comparisons of any conflicting or differing files\r\n * Filter out files or directories to avoid seeing spurious differences\r\n * Simple file management is also available\r\n\r\n#### Version control\r\n * Meld supports many version control systems, including Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and SVN\r\n * Launch file comparisons to check what changes were made, before you commit\r\n * View file versioning statuses\r\n * Simple version control actions are also available (i.e., commit/update/add/remove/delete files)\r\n \r\n#### Merge mode (in development)\r\n * Automatically merge two files using a common ancestor\r\n * Mark and display the base version of all conflicting changes in the middle pane\r\n * Visualise and merge independent modifications of the same file\r\n * Lock down read-only merge bases to avoid mistakes\r\n * Command line interface for easy integration with existing tools, including git mergetool","google":"UA-74111027-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
